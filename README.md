# kotlin-project-patterns

The project contained in this repository was part of the module "Explorando Padrões de Projetos na Prática com Java" (Exploring Project Patterns in Java, a hands-on approach, as translated personally) from the Code Update TQI - Backend with Kotlin and Java course, offered by the Digital Innovation One team.

The main goal of the project was to implement a simple API, in which there would be three different project patterns implemented, in order to observe and test different approaches, each one with their own advantages and disavantages.

From the video lessons, three patterns were presented: Singleton, Strategy, and Facade. After that, DIO given us the task to further expand on the code functionality and experiment with additional project patterns.

This time, I challenged myself with two objectives:
1. Develop the whole project using Kotlin, for it is a language in growth, being more and more adopted recently, and also the main focus of the Code Update course.
2. Add tests to my application, so that it behaves in a more predictable way, grants my code consistency, sturdiness and grants me an opportunity to handle testing in a new language.
The result is here presented. A simple API built in Kotlin using Spring, Java SDK version 17, testing built using the Mockk library, along with JUnit.

The endpoints are shown and can be tested on the URL http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html when running the project locally.
